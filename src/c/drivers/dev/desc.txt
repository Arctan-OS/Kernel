Data drivers are drivers for blocks of data.

They do not conform to the regular driver structure,
where the function information is listed in an array
created at compile time. Rather, these have header files
which will be directly included by other files using
the data driver at hand.

Data drivers can have their own sets of functions, and
serve to provide a way to easily manipulate the data
which may be found inside of a file.
